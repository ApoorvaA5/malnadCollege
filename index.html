<h1 class="upper-section">History of MCE</h1>
<div class="right-side2">

<P  class="right-side2">The Late Honorable Shree Chandappa Patil, Indian administrative Service (IAS). was the brain behind the evolution of Malnad 
  Engineering College, Hassan. He was the Hassan District Commissioner then. The Coffee Planters around and other local farmers and
   many others contributed financially to make this college a reality. Mr Chandappa Patil, was a gentleman of humble origins. He was
    the first graduate from his village and had a vision to bring education to the masses in Karnataka, however remote the place was. 
    This was his first venture. He worked very closely with the Late and Ex Vice President of India, Mr Jatti to open more educational
     institutions. The college was affiliated to the University of Mysore but changed affiliation to Visvesvaraya Technological
      University, Belgaum. In 2007 the college became autonomous.</P>
